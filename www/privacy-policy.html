Some examples of aggregated information are the percentage of customers who live in a particular country or who have a particular area code.</p><p id="demographic_info"><b>Demographic information</b>.&nbsp;Demographic information includes information such as title, geographic location, the industry that you work in, country domain, the language you selected for viewing order forms or other documents, and the currency in which you viewed prices if such feature is available.</p><p id="technical_info"><b>Technical information</b>.&nbsp;Examples of technical information include: your browser type and language choice; operating system name and version; system configuration information (such as processor, memory, and graphics card); Autodesk product commands and operations used;&nbsp; request and activation codes; product release, version, and language; graphics configuration driver name and version; list of applications running at the time of an error and other error conditions; list of Autodesk products and services installed on the computer you are using; Autodesk product serial numbers; and format and source of data imported or exported from Autodesk products or services. </p></blockquote><p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p></div><div class="clear"> </div><div id="section17" class="section normal"><p id="error_reports"><b>Error reports<br /></b>Autodesk offers the Customer Error Reporting (“CER”) tool, and from time to time offers other product specific error reporting tools.</p><blockquote><p><b>The CER tool</b><b>.</b> The CER dialog box appears whenever the Autodesk product you are using closes unexpectedly. If you choose to send an error report to Autodesk, the report is sent to Autodesk in encrypted form. When Autodesk receives the error report, automated systems sort the reports so that Autodesk developers can review and analyze the data. Once a software error is believed to be fixed, it is included in either a future maintenance update or the next release of the product. Autodesk may also notify those customers who initially reported the error, if they included their e-mail address in the customer error report.</p><p>CER collects and sends the following information as part of the error reporting process: </p><ul><li>Operating system name and version </li><li>Autodesk product name, version, and serial number </li><li>Graphics configuration driver name and version </li><li>List of Autodesk applications loaded when an error occurs </li><li>List of recent Autodesk commands </li><li>Portion of Autodesk program in memory when an error occurs&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></li><ul><li>If personal information or confidential information is in the system memory when the software error occurs, it may be sent to Autodesk with the error report through the CER feature.

About once a day, a small file containing this CIP information is sent in encrypted form to Autodesk’s CIP servers. </p><p>The following types of information may be collected from all CIP participants: </p><ul><li>Operating system name and version </li><li>System configuration information, such as processor, memory, and graphics card </li><li>Autodesk product commands and operations used </li><li>Name, serial number, and version of Autodesk products </li><li>Error conditions </li><li>Format and source of data imported or exported from Autodesk products </li><li>IP address&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In addition to the information listed above, the CIP may allow a participant to submit contact information (such as the participant’s e-mail address and company name).
